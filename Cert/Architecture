Execution Modes:
- Local
- Client
- Cluster - Allocates resources in cluster manager on cluster mode

Who schedules task on a cluster in Client mode?
- Spark driver schedules tasks on the cluster. 

Spark UI
Executor page shows driver and worker details. How much each core it's using.
Environment - Consolidated view of relevant properties

Executors (Workers) and Slots:

Executors:
- If you configure the workers as 3 in the cluster configuration, there will be 3 executors
- Each executor will have 4 cores to process data (Depending on the configuration)

Slot:
- Core is called as SLOT. When data is not being processed, it's called as SLOT. 
- If 4 is the core and 3 executors, then total capicity with respect to total slots would be 12 (3 executors x 4 cores)
- Driver decides which task should be done and allocates it to empty slots. If a slot is busy, then driver will allocate to other empty slots.
- Data is converted to Task as soon as the data is being processed by the slot
- If a driver submits task that requires 80 tasks, at a time only 12 tasks will be processed. 1 task per core. Once task is completed, slots will be available to take additional tasks.

Task:
- Deepest level of Spark Execution

Adaptive Execution:
- If a shuffle operation happens, the job will use entire paritions to process a small data file if adaptive execution is disabled.
- If enabled, it will use lesser number of paritions for a shuffle
- It also optimizes partiion pruning

# adaptive execution
spark.conf.get("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled")

# get parition
spark.conf.get("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions")

High level categories of adaptive execution:
- Coalescing post shuffle partitions (property: spark.sql.adaptive.coalesce.paritions.enabled)
- Converting sort merge join to broadcast join (property: spark.sql.adaptive.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold)
- Converting sort merge join to shuffled hash join (property: spark.sql.adaptive.maxShuffledHashjoinLocalMapThreshold)
- Optimizing Skew join (property: spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled)

Dataset API
- Dataset API is not available in Python. Only available in Scala.
